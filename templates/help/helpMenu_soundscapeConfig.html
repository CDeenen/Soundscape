        <h1>Soundscape Configuration</h1>
        In this screen you can manage your soundscapes. You will find a list of all the stored soundscapes.<br>
        Each soundscape has multiple buttons:
        <ul>
            <li><b>Load</b>: This will load the soundscape into the mixer</li>
            <li><b>Move Down</b>: Moves the soundscape one position down</li>
            <li><b>Move Up</b>: Moves the soundscape one position up</li>
            <li><b>Copy Soundboard to Selected</b>: Copies the soundboard from this soundscape to all soundscapes with 'select' ticked</li>
            <li><b>Select</b>: Used to select which soundscapes to target for various actions</li>
        </ul>
        At the bottom you will find the multiple buttons. Whenever 'selected soundscapes' are mentioned, this means that it applies to the soundscapes with 'select' ticked.
        <ul>
            <li><b>Select All</b>: Selects all soundscapes</li>
            <li><b>Deselect All</b>: Deselects all soundscapes</li>
            <li><b>Add Soundscape</b>: Adds a new soundscape to the bottom of the list</li>
            <li><b>Duplicate Selected</b>: Duplicates all selected soundscapes to the bottom of the list</li>
            <li><b>Delete Selected</b>: Deletes the selected soundscapes</li>
            <li><b>Export Selected</b>: Exports the selected soundscapes to a file, see below</li>
            <li><b>Import</b>: Imports soundsboards from a file and adds them to the bottom of the list, see below</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Importing and Exporting Soundscapes</h2>
        Importing and exporting allows you to save soundscapes, or share them with friends. There is one important caveat:<br>
        Only the metadata of the sounds is exported/imported.<br>
        This means that when you import a file, you need to have all the sound files in the same relative location as when it was exported.<br>
        For example, if you export a soundscape that uses sounds from a specific playlist, when you import the soundscape you need to have the exact same playlist and sounds set up in Foundry. 
        For files picked with the file picker, the relative location must be the same. So if you have a file at location 'Data/Assets/Thunder.mp3', when you import the soundscape, you must have a 
        file named 'Thunder.mp3' in the folder Data/Assets.
