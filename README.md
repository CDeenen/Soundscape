<h2>Introduction</h2>
<b>This module only works in Foundry 0.8. It will not be made backwards compatible with Foundry 0.7, since it relies on a lot of the new audio features of 0.8</b><br>
<b>Please note that this module is still in its infancy. There are still multiple bugs, and you should consider it being in beta.</b><br>
<br>
Soundscape is a Foundry VTT module that gives users an easy way to mix down multiple audio tracks into a single highly configurable soundscape. The individual volumes of the sounds can be changed on the fly, 
and multiple effects can be applied to the sounds in order to create the perfect soundscape. Besides that, there is a built-in soundboard that can be 
used for short sound effects, such as weapon or spell attack sounds.<br>
<br>
Multiple soundscapes, each with their own sounds and soundboard, can be set up and navigated through. There is also the option to import and export the soundscapes, either for backup, or for sharing them with your friends.<br>

<h2>Abandonment</h2>
Abandoned modules are a (potential) problem for Foundry, because users and/or other modules might rely on abandoned modules, which might break in future Foundry updates.<br>
I consider this module abandoned if all of the below cases apply:
<ul>
  <li>This module/github page has not received any updates in at least 3 months</li>
  <li>I have not posted anything on "the Foundry", "the League of Extraordinary Foundry VTT Developers" or the "Material Foundry" Discord servers in at least 3 months</li>
  <li>I have not responded to emails or PMs on Discord in at least 1 month</li>
  <li>I have not announced a temporary break from development, unless the announced end date of this break has been passed by at least 3 months</li>
</ul>
If the above cases apply (as judged by the "League of Extraordinary Foundry VTT Developers" admins), I give permission to the "League of Extraordinary Foundry VTT Developers" admins to assign one or more developers to take over this module, including requesting the Foundry team to reassign the module to the new developer(s).<br>
I require the "League of Extraordinary Foundry VTT Developers" admins to send me an email 2 weeks before the reassignment takes place, to give me one last chance to prevent the reassignment.<br>
I require to be credited for my work in all future releases.
